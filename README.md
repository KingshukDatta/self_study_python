## 📖 About

Welcome to **self_study_python**. This repository serves as a collection of my personal notes, code snippets, and exercises compiled while self-studying Python.

The contents of this repository are based on learnings gathered from various documentation, tutorials, and educational websites. The primary focus is to document concepts for future reference and practice.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The core of this repository is a Jupyter Notebook which contains the code and notes:

- **`Python_Notes.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing practical examples, syntax explanations, and logic trials.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

*Note: This notebook covers various fundamental and intermediate Python concepts, including but not limited to:*

- [ ] Python Syntax & Variables
- [ ] Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples)
- [ ] Control Flow (If/Else, Loops)
- [ ] Functions & Lambda Expressions
- [ ] Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects)
- [ ] Error Handling (Try/Except)
- [ ] *Add more specific topics here (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, File I/O)*
